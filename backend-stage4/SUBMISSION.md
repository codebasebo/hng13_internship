# Stage 4 Submission Manifest

Please fill the placeholders below before submitting to Airtable.

- Group Number: **<REPLACE_WITH_GROUP_NUMBER>**
- GitHub Repository URL: https://github.com/codebasebo/hng13_internship
- API Gateway URL: https://hng13internship-production-a451.up.railway.app
- System Design Diagram URL: https://github.com/codebasebo/hng13_internship/blob/main/backend-stage4/docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md
- Demo Video URL: **<REPLACE_WITH_DEMO_VIDEO_URL>**

Notes:
- The `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` file contains a Mermaid diagram and an explanation. You can paste the GitHub URL above into Airtable.
- If you need a Draw.io/ Lucidchart link, I can export the Mermaid graph to an image and add it to the repo.

How I can help next:
- Replace the placeholders with your Group Number and Demo video link and commit it for you.
- Export the system diagram to PNG and add it to the repo for an external-shareable URL.
- Create a short demo script and optional TikTok video script.
