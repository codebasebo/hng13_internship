# Stage 4 Submission Manifest

## Submission Details

- **Group Number**: [YOUR_GROUP_NUMBER_HERE]
- **GitHub Repository URL**: https://github.com/codebasebo/hng13_internship
- **API Gateway URL**: https://hng13internship-production-a451.up.railway.app
- **System Design Diagram URL**: https://github.com/codebasebo/hng13_internship/blob/main/backend-stage4/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md

Notes:
- The `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` file contains a Mermaid diagram and an explanation. You can paste the GitHub URL above into Airtable.
- If you need a Draw.io/ Lucidchart link, I can export the Mermaid graph to an image and add it to the repo.

How I can help next:
- Replace the placeholders with your Group Number and Demo video link and commit it for you.
- Export the system diagram to PNG and add it to the repo for an external-shareable URL.
- Create a short demo script and optional TikTok video script.
